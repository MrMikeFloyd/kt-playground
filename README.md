# Kotlin Playground

A dead simple, "try-out-stuff" Kotlin project. There's no underlying concept of any kind, just code for messing around. I used this for getting my hands dirty on Kotlin as I don't have any projects involving it at the moment. 

## How to Run

Although being a gradle project, I never actually build this, I just run everything in the IDE.

## Resources

I used 

* the excellent [Kotlin online docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)
* the pretty good [Kotlin in Action Book](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)
* a [60-minute Kotlin quickstart course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlin-for-developers)

for inspiration and getting started.
